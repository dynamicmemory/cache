# Cache

Cache is my first program written in **C#**, built as a foundation for a much 
larger project down the line.

---

## Overview

Cache is designed to help you make **fast context switches** — a digital workspace 
for managing current tasks, projects, thoughts, or future ideas.  
It’s a place to offload what’s in your head for **quick retrieval and fluid workflow management**.

The project began as a **CLI prototype** (now complete) and is moving into 
**Phase 2: the desktop interface**, using the **Avalonia UI framework** for full 
cross-platform compatibility.

---

## Goals

- 🧠 Lightweight productivity manager for fast mental context switching  
- 🗂️ Interactive drag-and-drop Kanban-style interface  
- 💾 Persistent data storage (JSON → SQLite/PostgreSQL)  
- 💻 Cross-platform desktop application (Linux-first)  
- 🌐 Potential web version (future exploration)

---

## Status

- ✅ **Phase 1:** CLI prototype complete  
- 🚧 **Phase 2:** Building the Avalonia-based desktop interface  
- 🔮 **Phase 3:** Web version and extended ecosystem integration  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C# (.NET)
- **UI Framework:** Avalonia
- **Storage:** JSON (prototype) → SQLite/PostgreSQL (desktop)
- **Architecture:** MVVM-style separation of logic and UI

---

## Future

Cache is one component in a broader system of tools — a step toward a larger
framework project currently in concept under the name **Latent**.

## License

TBD — likely MIT once stable.
